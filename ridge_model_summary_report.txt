9. INTERPRETATION OF KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------

A. CRITICAL PREDICTORS OF ROAD CRASHES:
1. **Total_Vehicles_Involved**: Strongest positive predictor
   → Each additional vehicle increases predicted crashes by significant margin

2. **SPV (Speed Violation)**: Second most important feature
   → Speed-related violations are strongly correlated with crash frequency

3. **Other_Factors**: Major contributor to crash predictions
   → Non-standard factors play substantial role in crash occurrence

B. SEASONAL/QUARTERLY PATTERNS:
1. **Quarter_Sin & Quarter_Cos**: Show significant coefficients
   → Clear seasonal patterns in crash occurrences throughout the year
   → Model captures cyclic variations in crash frequency

C. REGIONAL INSIGHTS:
1. **Regional variations captured through feature interactions**
2. **Certain months/quarters show higher crash propensities**

10. POLICY AND INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------

1. **TARGET SPEED ENFORCEMENT**:
   → SPV is key predictor; enhanced speed monitoring needed

2. **VEHICLE DENSITY MANAGEMENT**:
   → Total vehicles involved strongly predicts crashes
   → Consider traffic flow optimization in high-risk areas

3. **SEASONAL ADAPTATIONS**:
   → Adjust enforcement based on quarterly patterns
   → Increase patrols during high-risk periods

4. **DATA-DRIVEN RESOURCE ALLOCATION**:
   → Use model predictions to allocate emergency services
   → Target interventions in high-probability crash zones

11. MODEL LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------
1. **Limited Temporal Resolution**: Quarterly data only
   → Recommendation: Collect monthly/daily data

2. **Feature Engineering Opportunities**:
   → Add weather data, road conditions, time-of-day factors

3. **Non-linear Relationships**:
   → Consider polynomial features or tree-based models

4. **External Factors**:
   → Incorporate economic indicators, population density
